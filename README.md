# Pipecleaning_test
Pipecleaning test for MSc project.

The initial test was to check the basic connectivity.

The "Steane_code_with_two_logical_qubits.ipynb" file is a more extensive test.

It sets up two logical qubits in the Steane code and then entangles them with a logical Hadamard and a logical CX.

An appropriate noise model is applied.
